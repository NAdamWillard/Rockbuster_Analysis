### Here is a SQL query demonstrating how to use a sub-query, which finds the Top 5 Rockbuster customers by country
### This shows the same results as in the CTE file, but this one uses a sub-query, whereas that one used a common table expression

SELECT all_customers.country,
	all_customers.all_customer_count,
	top_customers.top_customer_count

FROM
(SELECT DISTINCT D.country,
	COUNT (DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count
FROM customer A
			INNER JOIN rental E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
			INNER JOIN payment F ON E.rental_id = F.rental_id
			INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
			INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_ID = C.city_id
			INNER JOIN country D on C.country_ID = D.country_ID
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC) AS all_customers

INNER JOIN

(SELECT top_5_customers.country,
COUNT (top_5_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
