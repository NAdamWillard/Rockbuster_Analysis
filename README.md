# Rockbuster_analysis
This is a project demonstrating the use of SQL to analyze the Rockbuster database as part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics bootcamp.

## Objective

This project hypothesizes a brick-and-mortar DVD rental company that has decided to make the transition to offer online streaming services. To that end, this project has analyzed the existing SQL database of "Rockbuster" in order to identify which aspects of its portfolio demonstrate the best performance, in order to give direction towards their online launch.  The name "Rockbuster" is a spoof on the actual "Blockbuster" video store.

## Contents

This repository contains:

* Data dictionary created for this project
* Database relationship diagram of the Rockbuster SQL database
* "Queries" folder showcasing several of the more complicated queries created for this project
* "Final_results" folder containing the final project report (a powerpoint) and an excel spreadsheet with the selected data queried from the database, as well as the specific queries used to gain it

## Results

This project answered all of the questions posed in the project brief. This focused on things such as general statistics, where Rockbuster's most customers and their highest-paying customers are based, how sales figures vary by geogrphaic region, and a breakdown of top performing movie genres, actors, and ratings.

Additionally, a number of visualizations for this project were created in Tableau Public, which can be accessed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adam.willard/viz/RockbusterGraphs/RockbusterCustomersSalesMap#1).

## Data

This database is completely fabricated.  It's been provided for tutorial purposes by PostgreSQL, and can be found [here](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip).
