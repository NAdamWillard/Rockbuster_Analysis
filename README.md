# Rockbuster_analysis
This is a collection of SQL queries used to analyze the Rockbuster database as part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics bootcamp.

## Objective

This project hypothesizes a brick-and-mortar DVD rental company that has decided to make the transition to offer online streaming services. To that end, this project has analyzed the existing SQL database of "Rockbuster" in order to identify which aspects of its portfolio demonstrate the best performance, in order to give direction towards their online launch.  The name "Rockbuster" is a spoof on the actual "Blockbuster" video store.

## Data

This database is completely fabricated.  It's been provided for tutorial purposes by PostgreSQL, and can be found (here)[https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip]
